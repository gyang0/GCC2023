            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>This program simulates flooding, a consequence of rising sea levels. Click a point on the globe to see the potential way a flood could impact that area.</p>

            <p>This doesn't "solve" climate change, but it does help mitigate short-term concerns. By focusing on the areas/routes more susceptible to flooding, resources can be saved. The saved resources can then be contributed to other efforts, like tackling climate change.</p>

            <p>(Only a demo. Wildly inaccurate, due to program & data limitations.)</p>

            <h1>How to Use</h1>
            <p>Click any region on the globe to get the elevation and likely path of flood.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Elevation: approximate elevation of selected point on map</li>
                <li>Lowest sea level: lowest sea level such that the selected area can still flood. In most cases it'll be close to the actual elevation, but it'll be higher if the area is surrounded by mountains or something.</li>
                <li>Path of the likely flood path is marked in red.</li>

                <br>

                <li>The second box contains information about the barriers that can be constructed.</li>
                <li>Barrier for blocking at coastline: Height of barrier required to block the flood if we're construting one at the coastline. Assuming that the flood follows the flood path.</li>
                <li>Lowest barrier along flood path: Minimum height of a barrier required to block the flood if we can construct one at any point on the flood path.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Code Notes</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>The grayscale map I used for the elevation data was "scaled 0-6400m." I'm interpreting that as black - 0m, white - 6400m, which seems reasonable.</li><br>

                <li>Map was converted from image to 2D array using a quick program in Java (coded within duration of Hackathon): <a href="https://github.com/gyang0/ImageConverter" target="_blank">https://github.com/gyang0/ImageConverter</a></li><br>

                <li>The "globe" is a square image warped using circle equations.</li><br>
                <li>How the path of likely flooding is determined:<br>
                    Binary search on all possible scaled sea levels 0-255 to find the lowest sea level where flooding is still possible (using BFS starting from selected point).<br>
                    Do BFS one more time to get the shortest path.<br>
                    Use the shortest path found from the BFS to mark squares on that path.
                </li>
            </ul>
